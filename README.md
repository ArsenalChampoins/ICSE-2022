To demonstrate the effectiveness of Grand in finding logic bugs in Gremlin-based graph database systems, we evaluate Grand on four widely-used graph database systems, and real-world logic bugs in them.

For all GDBs, we test their latest release versions when we start this work, i.e., Neo4j 3.2.3 (with Neo4j-Gremlin 3.4.10, not the latest version), JanusGraph 0.5.3, TinkerGraph 3.4.10, and HugeGraph 0.11.2. Note that, we use the latest version of Neo4j-Gremlin, but it does not support the latest Neo4j at that time.
