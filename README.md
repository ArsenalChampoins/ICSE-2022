## Bugs detected by Grand
You can download and decompress issue.rar under this repository to investigate the webpages of the 14 bug reports and a summary excel file.

To anonymize bug reports, we have deleted the bug reporter information in these webpages, thus these webpages will not reveal authorsâ€™ information. However, checking the original bug reports on the corresponding issue tracking systems may reveal our information.  
### So, *please <u>DO NOT</u> investigate the original bug reports in their issue tracking systems of these GDBs.*

To demonstrate the effectiveness of Grand in finding logic bugs in Gremlin-based graph database systems, we evaluate Grand on four widely-used graph database systems, and real-world logic bugs in them.

For all GDBs, we test their latest release versions when we start this work, i.e., Neo4j 3.2.3 (with Neo4j-Gremlin 3.4.10, not the latest version), JanusGraph 0.5.3, TinkerGraph 3.4.10, and HugeGraph 0.11.2. Note that, we use the latest version of Neo4j-Gremlin, but it does not support the latest Neo4j at that time.
